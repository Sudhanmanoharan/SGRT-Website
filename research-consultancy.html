                                                        loading. A pane of glass is usually designed to carry out only
                                                        out of plane loads and the only in-plane load for which it is
                                                        designed is its self-weight. But structural glass is subjected
                                                        to numerous loads like wind, snow, thermal stresses, earthquake
                                                        loads, live loads and impact load. For glass to be used as a
                                                        structural member, it should be designed to resist in-plane
                                                        loads. When glass is used as a load bearing wall or column it
                                                        should resist in plane compressive loads. But earthquake induces
